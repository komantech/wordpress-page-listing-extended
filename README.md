##WordPress page listing extended

Have you ever managed a WordPress website with thousends of static pages? If so, you are probably familiar with page templates. 

This plugin adresses one small problem that exists in default instalation - WordPress doesn't provide a column in page listing where you can find out what template is assigned to which page. 

Also, this plugin gives you nice ability to filter pages by registred templates in a system.

It will be soon available in WP/plugins repo.
